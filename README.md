# Procedural Dialogue Generation

This is a thesis project carried out at the **Laboratory of Musical Informatics (LIM)**. The purpose of the thesis is to create an audio dataset from various participants in a soundproof room and then have these individual dialogues interact to construct a discourse involving multiple people. 

## Documentation
[Document](TESI.MD)

[Test Protocol](PROTOCOLLO.MD)

## The Program

In the following repository, you'll find a program for procedural dialogue generation. The program takes a series of input files and concatenates them. The user can then decide various parameters such as the presence of burst, the number of questions, which values should be random, etc.

[Python Pseudo-Realistic Dialogue Generator](PYGenerator.py)

The **input file** types include:
- Question (e.g., "How was your day?")
- Response (e.g., "Not much, it was okay.")
- Prompt (e.g., "And you?")
- Burst (e.g., cough)

The **output file** types are:
- Individual audio files for each speaker
- A combined file summarizing the previous tracks

## Settings

Users can declare various values for dialogue generation. If absent, default values are used.

[Settings](PYGenerator.cfg)


Below is an example of the configuration file code.

Comments provide explanations for each parameter.

Commands, when uncommented and marked with "Example:", represent the program's default values.

```cfg
[global]
# if True, question order is random
random_q_order = True

```

custom_path file shoud have one of these formats:
```json
["03_M_Q_01_L.wav", "01_M_A_01_L", "03_M_Q_02_L", "01_M_A_02_L", "01_M_Q_02_L"]
```
```json
[{"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/03_M_Q_01_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "03_M_Q_01_L", "person": "03", "duplicated": false}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/01_M_A_01_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "01_M_A_01_L", "person": "01", "duplicated": false}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/03_M_Q_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "03_M_Q_02_L", "person": "03", "duplicated": true}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/01_M_A_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "01_M_A_02_L", "person": "01", "duplicated": true}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/01_M_Q_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "01_M_Q_02_L", "person": "01", "duplicated": true}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/07_M_A_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "07_M_A_02_L", "person": "07", "duplicated": false}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/07_M_I_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "07_M_I_02_L", "person": "07", "duplicated": true}, {"path": "C:/Users/giuli/Music/Edit\\INPUT/03_M_A_02_L.wav", "data": 0, "name": "03_M_A_02_L", "person": "03", "duplicated": true}]
```
if you want to specify a different position for a generation with ND volume, you can create a file with the same custom_path name, but, it needs to end with "_pos.json". Ã¹
Example: if custom_path is output_files.json, your positions file should be output_files_pos.json .
Inside that file, format should be:
```json
 {"01": 1, "02": 1, "03": 1, "04": 0}
```
